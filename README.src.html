<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The need for the spec-gen came from the need for long technical documents to
include niceties such as cross-references and a table of contents for the
purpose of easy navigation — doing this manually can be a great chore
especially when sections are numbered and a section is added, consequently
changing the numbering of many others, leading to it being advantageous to do it
programmatically.</p>

<p>The spec-gen does this on HTML documents, as a number of sequential
processes. Currently cross-referencing, section numbering, table of contents
creation, and a number of substitutions are done (mainly relating to the current
date).</p>

<h2>Installing the spec-gen</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The following are the minimum requirements: later versions should also work
without issue.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> 2.5
	<li><a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a> 2.0
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib">html5lib</a> 0.10
</ul>

<h3>Obtaining a copy</h3>

<p>Releases are occasionally made. A link to the latest release can be found
from the <a href="http://spec-gen.gsnedders.com">spec-gen website</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a copy can be obtained from <dfn>our <a
href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">Mercurial</a> repository</dfn>: this is
where our ongoing development occurs, and allows any revision (and therefore any
release) to be downloaded. Our repository is located at
<code><!--begin-link-->http://hg.gsnedders.com/spec-gen/<!--end-link--></code>.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Normally, installation is done through <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>, with the following
command:</p>

<p><code>python setup.py install</code></p>

<p>Please see setuptools' documentation for information on installation options
(such as installing in non-standard locations).</p>

<h3>Running the test suite</h3>

<p>The source distribution and the current development copy (in <span title="our
mercurial repository">Mercurial</span>) both contain a test suite. It can be run
with the following command:</p>

<p><code>python runtests.py</code></p>

<p>Any test failures should be reported at our <dfn><a
href="http://bugs.gsnedders.com/projects/show/spec-gen">bug
tracker</a></dfn>.</p>

<h2>Using the spec-gen</h2>

<p>The spec-gen is invoked through the <code>spec-gen</code> command. The
<dfn><code>--help</code></dfn> (or <dfn><code>-h</code></dfn>) option gives some
basic help.</p>

<p>The <dfn><code>--enable</code></dfn> and <dfn><code>--disable</code></dfn>
options enable/disable respectively the process given as the option value (e.g.,
<code>--disable=toc</code> disables building the <span title="table of
contents/section numbering">table of contents and numbering sections</span>).
The default processes are <code>sub</code> (<span>substitution</span>),
<code>toc</code> (<span>table of contents/section numbering</span>), and
<code>xref</code> (<span>cross-referencing</span>). Any enabled process loaded
via <code>from processes import foo</code>, and if that fails <code>import
foo</code> (where <code>foo</code> is the process), and is then called as
<code>foo.foo(ElementTree, **kwargs)</code>.</p>

<p>Some options alter what is used to parse and serialize the document: by
default, html5lib is used to parse the document; passing the
<dfn><code>--lxml.html</code></dfn> option uses libxml2's HTML parser and
serializer instead (this is quicker, but does not comply to the <a
href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a> standard, and sometimes results in a
<span>fatal error</span>)<!--; passing the XXX: need double hyphen
<dfn><code>xml</code></dfn> option uses libxml2's XML parser instead-->.</p>

<p>The spec-gen offers a <dfn>compatibility mode</dfn>, which aims to be
compatible with the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess">CSS3 module
postprocessor</a> (within reason). This is mainly provided for the sake of
pre-existing <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> documents. The
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat</code></dfn> option turns on this compatibility mode,
although specific options that turn on just one compatibility feature at a time
are also available (and are documented below under each <span
title="processes">process</span>) — these are all implied by the
<code>--w3c-compat</code> options, with one exception:
<code>--w3c-compat-crazy-substitutions</code>, as it can lead to undesirable
results.</p>

<p>The options <dfn><code>--newline-char</code></dfn> and
<dfn><code>--indent-char</code></dfn> set the newline and indent strings (they
do not have to be a single character) respecively. They default to U+000A LINE
FEED (LF) and U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) respectively. These are only
used when generating large trees of generated markup, such as the table of
contents.</p>

<p>Upon a <dfn>fatal error</dfn>, processing of the document is terminated and
the output file is left unchanged.</p>

<p>The <dfn>textContent</dfn> property is the same as that defined in <a
href="http://w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/">DOM Level 3 Core</a> on the Node
interface.</p>

<p><dfn>Whitespace</dfn> is as defined in <a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML
5</a>: <q>U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED
(LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)</q>.</p>

<p><dfn>Interactive content</dfn> is as defined in
<a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>: the <code>a</code>,
<code>bb</code>, <code>details</code>, and <code>datagrid</code> elements; the
<code>audio</code> and <code>video</code> elements when they have a
<code>controls</code> attribute; the <code>menu</code> element when the
<code>type</code> attribute is case-insensitively equal to
<code>toolbar</code>.</p>

<p><dfn title="id generation">When an <code>id</code> attribute is needed, it is
created as follows</dfn>:

<ol>
	<li>If the element already has an <code>id</code> attribute, its value is
used, and this algorithm stops; otherwise:
	<li>If the <code>title</code> attribute's value is not empty, and does not
consist of <span>whitespace</span> only, let <var>generated_id</var> be equal to
its value; otherwise, let <var>generated_id</var> be equal to
<span>textContent</span>.
	<li>The <var>generated_id</var> is stripped of leading/trailing
<span>whitespace</span> and converted to lowercase (behaviour of this is
dependent on the current locale setting of Python).
	<li>The first of the following list whose condition matches the current
state of the string is done:
		<ol>
			<li>If <var>generated_id</var> is an empty string,
<var>generated_id</var> is set to <code>generatedID</code>.
			<li>If the DOCTYPE's public identifier is one of <code>-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.0//EN</code>, <code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN</code>,
<code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN</code>, <code>-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.01//EN</code>, <code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN</code>,
<code>-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN</code>, <code>ISO/IEC 15445:2000//DTD
HyperText Markup Language//EN</code>, <code>ISO/IEC 15445:2000//DTD
HTML//EN</code>, <code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN</code>,
<code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN</code>, <code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Frameset//EN</code>, or <code>-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN</code>; or the
<dfn><code>--force-html4-id</code></dfn> option is used:
				<ol>
					<li>All runs of characters apart from U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS
(-), U+002E FULL STOP (.), U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (0–9),
U+003A COLON (:), U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z
(A–Z), U+005F LOW LINE (_), and U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN
SMALL LETTER Z (a–z) are replaced by a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-)
character within <var>generated_id</var>.
					<li>Leading and trailing U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) characters
are removed from <var>generated_id</var>.
					<li>If <var>generated_id</var> is not empty, if the first
character is not in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER Z (A–Z) or U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL
LETTER Z (a–z), <var>generated_id</var> is prefixed by a single U+0078 LATIN
SMALL LETTER X (x) character; otherwise, <var>generated_id</var> is set to
<code>generatedID</code>.
				</ol>
			<li>Otherwise, runs of characters that do not match the ifragment
production in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987">RFC 3987</a> are
replaced by a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-) character within
<var>generated_id</var>, and then leading and trailing U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-)
characters are removed from <var>generated_id</var>.
		</ol>
	<li>If <var>generated_id</var> matches a ready-existing ID, continue to the
next step; otherwise, jump to step 7.
	<li>Increment <var>i</var> by one, or set it to one if it doesn't already
exist.
	<li>Go to step 4.
	<li>The generated ID is <var>generated_id</var>.
</ol>

<p>Other <span title="processes">process</span> specific options are documented
under the <span title="processes">process</span> to which they belong.</p>

<h2><dfn>Processes</dfn></h2>

<p>The elements listed in the below processes, except where otherwise stated,
are the local name of the element <!--either--> in null namespace<!-- or in the
<dfn>HTML namespace</dfn> (<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>)-->.</p>

<h3><dfn>Cross-referencing</dfn></h3>

<p>Cross-referencing has three essential parts:
<dfn title="definition">definitions</dfn> that define
<dfn title="term">terms</dfn>, and <dfn title="instance">instances</dfn> of
those <span title="term">terms</span>.</p>

<p><span title="definition">Definitions</span> are marked-up using the
<code>dfn</code> element: the <span>definition</span> itself is taken from the
<code>title</code> attribute if it is present, otherwise it is taken from the
<span>textContent</span> property of the <code>dfn</code> element. By default,
the spec-gen will throw a <span>fatal error</span> if a <span>term</span> is
defined more than once: this behaviour can be turned off (causing the final
<span>definition</span> of the <span>term</span> to be the one that is used) by
the <dfn><code>--allow-duplicate-dfns</code></dfn> option.

<p><span title="instance">Instances</span> are marked-up with various elements,
depending on the setting of <dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-elements</code></dfn>:
if it is disabled (the default), the <code>abbr</code>, <code>code</code>,
<code>i</code>, <code>span</code>, and <code>var</code> elements are used for
<span title="instance">instances</span>; if it is enabled, the
<code>abbr</code>, <code>acronym</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>bdo</code>,
<code>big</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>del</code>, <code>em</code>,
<code>i</code>, <code>ins</code>, <code>kbd</code>, <code>label</code>,
<code>legend</code>, <code>q</code>, <code>samp</code>, <code>small</code>,
<code>span</code>, <code>strong</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>sup</code>,
<code>tt</code>, <code>var</code> elements are used for <span
title="instance">instances</span>. Those that are only there in
<span>compatibility mode</span> are there because either they should not
semantically be used for an <span>instance</span>, or because they are not
present in <a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>. Similar to <span
title="definition">definitions</span>, the <span>instance</span> is taken from
the <code>title</code> attribute if it is present, otherwise it is taken from
the <span>textContent</span> property. An <span>instance</span> is only used if
it does not have an <span>interactive content</span> or <code>dfn</code> element
as either a parent or a child.</p>

<p>Both <span title="definition">definitions</span> and <span
title="instance">instances</span> are <dfn title="cross-reference
normalization">normalized</dfn> as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span> is stripped,
	<li>Converted to lowercase (behaviour of this is dependent on the current
locale setting of Python),
	<li>All consecutive <span>whitespace</span> is replaced with a single U+0020
SPACE CHARACTER<!-- unless there is a <code>pre</code> element as a parent-->,
and
	<li>If <dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-normalization</code></dfn> is enabled,
all characters apart from U+0020 SPACE CHARACTER, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-),
U+0030 DIGIT ZERO to U+0039 DIGIT NINE (0–9), U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to
U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z (A–Z), and U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A
LATIN SMALL LETTER Z (a–z) are removed.
</ul>

<p>If the <span>instance</span> is contained within a <code>span</code> element,
the <code>span</code> element is turned into an <code>a</code> element, and a
<code>href</code> attribute is added to link it to the <span>definition</span>
(e.g., <code>&lt;span>foo&lt;/span></code> becomes <code>&lt;a
href=#foo>foo&lt;/a></code>) — all other attributes are preserved. Otherwise
(when the <span>instance</span> is not contained within a <code>span</code>
element), the location of the <code>a</code> element when linking an
<span>instance</span> is dependent on the
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-xref-a-placement</code></dfn> option: if it is disabled
(the default), the <code>a</code> element is placed around the element
containing the <span>instance</span> (e.g., <code>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i></code>
becomes <code>&lt;a href=#foo>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i>&lt;/a></code>); if it is enabled,
the <code>a</code> element goes within the element containing the
<span>instance</span> and goes around all of its content (e.g.,
<code>&lt;i>foo&lt;/i></code> becomes <code>&lt;i>&lt;a
href=#foo>foo&lt;/a>&lt;/i></code>).</p>

<h3><dfn>Table of contents/section numbering</dfn></h3>

<p>To create a table of contents, and to number the <span
title="section">sections</span> of the document, an <dfn>outline</dfn> is
created (this is a list of <span title="section">sections</span>, which can each
contain more <span title="section">sections</span>, where a <dfn>section</dfn>
represents a part of the document, and often has a <dfn title="section
heading">heading</dfn> associated with it — for more detailed definitions see
<a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML 5</a>). This means not only are the
<code>h1</code>–<code>h6</code> elements supported, but also elements such as
<code title="">section</code> are used to create the <span>outline</span>. After
creating the
<span>outline</span>, every <span>section</span> with a depth between those
provided by <dfn><code>--min-depth</code></dfn> and
<dfn><code>--max-depth</code></dfn> (defaulting to two and six respectively),
and which has a <span title="section heading">heading</span>, is numbered if it
does not have <code>no-num</code> as a class, and is added to the table of
contents if it does not have <code>no-toc</code> as a class. <span
title="section">Sections</span> without a <span title="section
heading">heading</span> are treated as if they did not exist, unless they have
children, in which they will appear to exist while not existing all at once
(e.g., they increment the <span>section</span> numbering, though that is not
output anywhere; and they get a list item in the table of contents, with only
the children within it, and no link to the <span>section</span> itself).</p>

<p>The format of <span>section</span> numbers should comply with <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6937">ISO
2145:1978</a>, Numbering of divisions and subdivisions in written documents.
This means that each <span>section</span> number is given by Arabic numerals,
seperated by a single U+002E FULL STOP character, and there is no trailing
U+002E FULL STOP character.</p>

<p>The <span>section</span> number is inserted as the first child node of the
<span>section heading</span> as a <code>span</code> element with the
<code>class</code> attribute set to <code>secno</code>: this is copied into the
table of contents.</p>

<p>Pre-existing <code>span</code> elements with a class of <code>secno</code>
are removed from all <span title="section heading">section headings</span>,
regardless of whether their depth falls within the range given by
<code>--min-depth</code> and <code>--max-depth</code>.</p>

<p>The table of contents is built up as an ordered list (an <code>ol</code>
element), with each <span>section</span> marked up as a <code>li</code> element,
and child <span title="section">sections</span> are marked up with an
<code>ol</code> within that <code>li</code> (and this continues recursively, ad
infinitum). By default, the root element of the table of contents (an
<code>ol</code> element) is given a <code>class</code> attribute set to
<code>toc</code>; however, with the
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-class-toc</code></dfn> option this is placed on every
<code>ol</code> within the table of contents. The entire <span>section
heading</span> is copied to be the content of the list item, with all
<span>interactive content</span> elements and <code>id</code> attributes
removed.</p>

<p>A <span>normal comment substitution</span> is done with
<var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>toc</code>, and the table of contents
as the replacement.</p>

<h3><dfn>Substitution</dfn></h3>

<p>Various strings are replaced in magic ways: a <dfn>normal string
substitution</dfn> takes the form of <code>[xxx]</code> where xxx is
case-sensitively the replacement, which may be followed by any characters apart
from U+005D RIGHT SQUARE BRACKET (]) before the final U+005D RIGHT SQUARE
BRACKET character — these extra characters are effectively a comment, and
carry absolutely no meaning, and vanish into some as-of-yet unknown abyss when
the string replacement is done. The entire string must be contained within a
single text node.</p>

<p>A <dfn>normal comment substitution</dfn> is one where there is a string,
<var>sub_identifier</var>, that identifies the comment for the substitution, and
the replacement. All nodes between a comment with a value equal to (with leading
and trailing <span>whitespace</span> removed) <code>begin-</code> followed by
<var>sub_identifier</var> and one with q value equal to (with leading and
trailing <span>whitespace</span> removed) <code>end-</code> followed by
<var>sub_identifier</var> are removed, and replaced with the replacement.
Additionally, any comment (with leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span>
removed) with a value equal to <var>sub_identifier</var> is replaced with a
comment with a value of <code>begin-</code> followed by
<var>sub_identifier</var>, the replacement, and then a comment with a value of
<code>end-</code> followed by <var>sub_identifier</var>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>W3C status</dfn> is found, when needed by one of the substitutions,
by iterating all text nodes in document order (i.e., attribute values and
comments have no effect), and for each node, the following is done (in this
order):</p>

<ol>
	<li>If the node contains, case-insensitively, "latest version" (where the
middle space is one or more U+0020 SPACE, U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab),
U+000A LINE FEED (LF), or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters — a difference from the normal definition of <span>whitespace</span>, as it does not include
U+000C FORM FEED (FF)), searching stops, and the default is used (ED).
	<li>Otherwise, if the node, case-sensitively, contains
"http://www.w3.org/TR/" followed by one of "MO", "WD", "CR", "PR", "REC", "PER",
or "NOTE", which in turn is followed by U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (-), then searching
stops, and the status is whatever matched the previous list of options by the
first match in the text node.
</ol>

<p>A side-effect of doing it in this order is the fact that if a node contains
both of these possible strings is that the latter is ignored, meaning that the
default (ED) is used.</p>

<!-- I wish the above was more sane — it took me several hours to work out
(though the comment in the CSS3 Module Postprocessor docs saying, "If there is a
H2 subheading under the H1 that gives the spec's status, the [STATUS] variable
will be initialized from that, otherwise it will default to WD." did not help me
work it out quickly, as what is done is completely utterly different to that)
— even though the algorithm is simple enough, it is just far too unexpected.
Sadly, though, pre-existing documents depend on this very exact behaviour, and
thus it cannot be changed. -->

<p>There is also a <dfn>long W3C status</dfn>, which correlates to the <span>W3C
status</span> under the following mapping:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th><span>W3C Status</span>
		<th><span>Long W3C Status</span>
	<tr>

		<td>REC

</table>

<p>By default, the <span title="normal string substitution">normal string
substitutions</span> are:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>[<!---->DATE]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the current date for UTC±0 in the form of, e.g.,
<samp>31 July 2008</samp>. The word used for the month is dependent on the
current locale of Python. The number of the day of the month has no leading
zeros.
	<dt><code>[<!---->CDATE]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the current date for UTC±0 in the form YYYYMMDD,
e.g., <samp>20080731</samp>. This is a conforming <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874">ISO
8601:2004</a> date.
	<dt><code>[<!---->YEAR]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the current year for UTC±0, in the form YYYY,
e.g.,
<samp>2008</samp>. This is a conforming <a
href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874">ISO
8601:2004</a> year.
	<dt><code>[<!---->TITLE]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the <span>textContent</span> of the first
<code>title</code> element which is within the first <code>head</code> of the
document, or an empty string if such a <code>title</code> element does not
exist.
</dl>

<p>There is one comment substitution by default. Any nodes between a comment
with a value equal to (with leading and trailing <span>whitespace</span>
removed) <code>begin-link</code> and one with a value equal to
<code>end-link</code>, with <span>interactive content</span> elements removed
(though children of those elements preserved), are effectively wrapped in an
<code>a</code> element which has a <code>href</code> attribute equal to the
<code>textContent</code> of all the nodes between the two comments concatenated
in document order. The two comments must have the same parent, otherwise a
<span>fatal error</span> occurs.</p>

<p>If <dfn><code>--w3c-compat-substitutions</code></dfn> is enabled, the
following <span title="normal string substitution">normal string
substitutions</span> are done in addition to those above:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>[STATUS]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the <span>W3C status</span>.
	<dt><code>[LONGSTATUS]</code>
	<dd>This is replaced with the <span>long W3C status</span>.
</dl>

<p>Additionally, the following <span title="normal comment substitution">normal
comment substitutions</span> are done:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>logo</code>
	<dd>Replacement is equal to: <code>&lt;p>&lt;a
href="http://www.w3.org/">&lt;img alt="W3C"
src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home"/>&lt;/a>&lt;/p></code> (parsed as an XML
fragment, and serialized into the output document in the needed format).
	
	<dt><var>sub_identifier</var> equal to <code>copyright</code>
	<dd>Replacement is equal to: <code>&lt;p class="copyright">&lt;a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice#Copyright">Copyright&lt;/a>
&#xA9; [<!---->YEAR] &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/">&lt;acronym title="World

&lt;a

and &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">document
use&lt;/a> rules apply.&lt;/p></code> (parsed as an XML fragment, and serialized
into the output document in the needed format).
</dl>

<p>There is one further string substitution, and this is only done when
<dfn><code>--w3c-compat-crazy-substitutions</code></dfn> is enabled (note that
this is not included in <code>--w3c-compat</code>). A string of
<code>http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-</code> followed by one or more
characters in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER Z (A–Z) is replaced with whatever
<code>http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-[STATUS]</code> would evaluate to be.
Like the <span title="normal string substitution">normal string
substitutions</span>, this string must be contained in a single text node.</p>

<!-- Is that crazy enough to justify the option name? -->

<p>Special thanks to Bert Bos for creating the CSS3 Module Postprocessor, on
which this is partially based, and (with <code>--w3c-compat</code>) claims to be
partially compatible with. Further special thanks to Bert Bos for creating a
number of things (especially as the algorithm for finding the <span>W3C
status</span>) that took the author of the spec-gen many hours to reverse
engineer.</p>
